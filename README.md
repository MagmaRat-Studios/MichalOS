This project is essentially a beefed-up version of MikeOS 4.5. It includes high-end OS features, such as:
- Screensaver with customizable timeout
- Customizable user interface (custom background, window colors etc.)
- Custom font
- On-screen clock with timezone support
- AdLib synthesizer support
- Build-in graphics drawing functions

Even though all of these mind-blowing features are included, the system requirements are kept to a minimum:
	- Intel 80386 or higher, Pentium recommended
	- At least 80 kB RAM, 256 kB recommended
	- An EGA video card, VGA recommended
	- A keyboard
