# MichalOS
This project is essentially a beefed-up version of MikeOS 4.5. It includes high-end OS features, such as:
- Screensaver
- Customizable user interface
- Custom font
- On-screen clock with timezone support
- AdLib synthesizer support
- Build-in graphics functions

Even though all of these mind-blowing features are included, the OS only needs 128 kB to boot up!
