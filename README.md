This project is essentially a beefed-up version of MikeOS 4.5. It includes high-end OS features, such as:
- Screensaver with customizable timeout
- Customizable user interface (custom background, window colors etc.)
- Custom font
- On-screen clock with timezone support
- AdLib synthesizer support
- Build-in graphics drawing functions

Even though all of these mind-blowing features are included, the OS only requires 128 kB to boot up! (192 kB is recommended, though)
